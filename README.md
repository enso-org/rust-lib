Enso is an open-source, visual language for data science that lets you design,
prototype, develop and refactor any application by connecting visual elements
together. Enso lets you collaborate with your co-workers, interactively
fine-tune parameters, inspect results and visually profile and debug your
programs in real-time, creating a moment where the mind is free to let the body
create.

Enso consists of several sub projects, including the
[Enso Language Compiler](https://github.com/enso-org/enso) and the
[Enso Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://github.com/enso-org/ide).
You can also check out the [Enso Website](https://enso.org) for more
information.

This repository contains the rust libraries that are used to develop Enso. These
are published to [crates.io](https://crates.io).

### Releases

Releases are made for the individual libraries in this repository and are made
available on [crates.io](https://crates.io). Each release must correspond to a
_tag_ in the repository using the following format: `libname-version` where:

- `libname` is the name of the library (as it is imported).
- `version` is the version string using the [semver](https://semver.org/)
  version scheme.
