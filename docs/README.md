# Enso Rust Libraries Developer Documentation

This folder contains the documentation for the implementation of the various
libraries contained within this repo. The documentation is broken up by library
and each folder contains information about the design, specification, and
implementation of the library to which it pertains.

We provide a number of useful resources for getting a quick understanding of the
Enso rust libraries project:

- [**Contributing Guidelines:**](./CONTRIBUTING.md) Information for people
  wanting to contribute to these libraries (in many different ways).
- [**Security Guidelines:**](./SECURITY.md) Security guidelines for the Enso
  project, including supported versions and our vulnerability reporting process.

It is broken up into categories as follows:

- [**Flexer:**](./flexer) Information on the design of the flexer, a fast,
  finite-automaton-based lexing engine.
